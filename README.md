## Usage 🖥️ 
---
Users, upon visiting the app, see only a search bar and a navbar with the option to login or signup. Users can search for books or authors, and the results will display below. If a user clicks the logn/signup options, they are presented with a relevant form. Upon logging in, users see the same search bar and results, but with a button paired with every book that allows the user to save the book. The navbar changes to display a logout option and an option to view their saved books, the latter of which will take them to a new page populated by their saved books. 🖥️
